ack-results-parser
==================

A collection of scripts used to parse the output of an ACK run.


Dependencies
------------
Currently this script makes use of the '`models.py`' module from `auto-cert-kit.git`.

It is therefore important that you add the location of the `auto-cert-kit.git/kit` to 
your python path in order to make sure the correct modules are loaded.
